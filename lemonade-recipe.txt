Ingredients

    5 lbs lemons
    2 cups water
    2 cups sugar

Instructions

    Cut lemons in half.
    Juice each lemon through a strainer into a large measuring cup.
    Keep juicing until you have 2 cups of lemon juice.
    Pour water into a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat.
    Stir in sugar.
    Continue cooking over heat until sugar is dissolved and
    liquid looks clear again.
    Combine sugar solution with lemon juice.
    This is a lemonade concentrate.
    When ready to serve, add water to taste.

Notes
The lemonade concentrate can be frozen for later use. Just pour it
into a gallon-sized ziploc bag and lay flat in the freezer. When
ready to serve, thaw, and add water to taste.
